# NYC — API & Agent Modernization

Mapping the digital surface of New York City government — every public table, form, dataset, and portal — and turning it into an **API-first, agent-native** layer: individual JSON Schema per object, an OpenAPI contract that `$ref`s those objects, and an MCP server so the same resources are usable by both applications and AI agents.

This is the working project. It grew out of an [API Evangelist low-hanging-fruit assessment](https://apievangelist.com/2016/04/13/formalizing-my-approach-to-identifying-the-low-hanging-api-fruit/) — the same outside-in method used for the [University of Oklahoma](https://apievangelist.com/2014/10/12/an-outsidein-approach-to-jumpstarting-an-api-effort-at-the-university-of-oklahoma/) and the [Department of Veterans Affairs](https://api-evangelist.github.io/va-api-landscape/report/).

## Why this is *not* another data-liberation project

From roughly **2010 to 2018**, the open-data movement — led by **Socrata** (now Tyler), the Obama-era open-government directives, and NYC's own Open Data law — pushed cities to publish their data. NYC did: `data.cityofnewyork.us` hosts tens of thousands of datasets, and NYC Parks alone publishes **237 assets** there today.

**It only partially worked.** Publishing datasets is not the same as making a government programmable. What that era left us with:

- **Data without product.** Each dataset got a raw SODA endpoint, but there is no *resource-oriented* API — no "a Park has facilities, events, monuments, trees, and capital projects" model. Consumers get tables, not services.
- **Disconnected from the front door.** The public websites (e.g. `nycgovparks.org`) render their **own** parallel HTML and **never consume** the open-data twin. Two worlds, separately maintained, free to drift.
- **Read-only.** Open data liberated *reporting* data. The transactional workflows citizens actually need — permits, applications, registrations — stayed locked behind login-gated HTML forms with no API at all.
- **Not agent-ready.** None of it is exposed as tools an AI agent can call. In 2026 that is the gap that matters.

**This project is the next version.** Not "publish more CSVs." Instead:

> **Unify** what already exists behind coherent, resource-oriented APIs → **productize** with one JSON Schema per object and an OpenAPI contract → **complete** the missing write workflows (permits) → **expose** all of it through **MCP** so agents are first-class consumers.

Data liberation was step one, and it half-happened. This is step two: **making the city programmable.**

## Explore the site

This repo doubles as an explorable, data-driven website (**[nyc.apievangelist.com](https://nyc.apievangelist.com)**, GitHub Pages):

- `index.html` — project overview: thesis, cross-domain stats, the five verb families, the method, and cards for all 67 domains.
- `domain.html?d=<domain>` — per-domain explorer: interactive fruit index, searchable Open Data index, JSON Schema browser, OpenAPI operations, MCP tools, and rendered docs.
- `opportunity.html` · `linkage.html` · `transactions.html` — the assessment layer: priority ranking (demand×gap×feasibility), the cross-domain join-key graph, and the citizen-transaction taxonomy.
- `commons.html` — the **[`nyc-commons`](nyc-commons/README.md)** shared schema set: 21 canonical definitions (borough, BBL, address, place, party, dollar), the per-definition adoption report, and the cross-agency key registry.
- `standards.html` · `qa.html` — the standards NYC agencies should adopt (and the standards this project is built on), and the verification pass (66/67 high confidence).
- `entities.html` · `technology.html` — master cross-domain inventories.
- `docs.html?f=…` — in-browser Markdown viewer (also serves the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)).
- `data/manifest.json` — generated from the repo artifacts; the site reads it, so it stays accurate as domains are added. Regenerate after adding a domain: `python3 scripts/build-manifest.py && python3 scripts/build-scorecard.py` (and `build-commons.py` after touching any `_common.json`).

The site is dependency-free static HTML/CSS/JS — no build step.

**Enabling Pages:** Settings → Pages → *Deploy from a branch* → `main` / root. The custom domain is set via the `CNAME` file (`nyc.apievangelist.com`); add a DNS `CNAME` record `nyc → api-evangelist.github.io`. `.nojekyll` is present so files serve as-is.

See the **[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)** for the full project history, and the **[cross-domain SYNTHESIS](SYNTHESIS.md)** (interactive: `synthesis.html`) for the five-family taxonomy, the thirteen cross-cutting findings, and the aggregate maturity scorecard.

## Method (per domain)

1. **Low-hanging-fruit assessment** — outside-in crawl of the domain; index every table (>10 rows), form, and data file as `name · type · URL · entity`.
2. **Technology & vendor inventory** — fingerprint the CMS, hosting, CDN, analytics, and any outsourced capabilities (search, maps, identity) from headers and page markup. Vendor lock-in is a modernization constraint.
3. **APIs-observed inventory** — document every backend/service API the site itself calls while crawling (internal REST, vendor APIs, blob stores, the open-data SODA endpoints). The *existing* programmatic surface.
4. **Open Data crosswalk** — match each resource to any existing `data.cityofnewyork.us` dataset; separate real gaps from already-published-but-disconnected data.
5. **JSON Schema per object** — one canonical schema file per entity, reconciling the website's columns with the Open Data column schemas.
6. **OpenAPI** — a resource-oriented contract that `$ref`s each object schema; reads over unified data, writes for the missing transactional workflows.
7. **MCP** — expose the same resources as agent tools (design artifact, not a deployment).

## Status

**Sixty-seven domains assessed** — the full NYC government surface (2,666 Open Data assets mapped, 422 JSON Schemas, 721 API operations, 624 MCP tools). One flat truth: open data is broad, but **65 of 67 domains have no transactional write API and all 67 have no agent surface.** The ~40 modernization verbs collapse into five families — Digitize · Expose · Unify/Federate · Transact · Standardize. Full analysis in the [cross-domain SYNTHESIS](SYNTHESIS.md) and the interactive [aggregate scorecard](https://nyc.apievangelist.com/synthesis.html). Every domain is explorable at [nyc.apievangelist.com](https://nyc.apievangelist.com).

The first five, five distinct verbs:

| Domain | Platform | Machine-readable coverage | Verb |
|---|---|---|---|
| nycgovparks.org | Smarty/PHP | 237 Open Data assets | **replatform** |
| schools.nyc.gov | Sitefinity/.NET | 638 assets; rented search, hidden backend | **reclaim** |
| council.nyc.gov | WordPress | 3 APIs, none owned | **consolidate + own** |
| vote.nyc | Drupal 9 | 2 assets; results/candidates PDF-only | **digitize** |
| portal.311.nyc.gov | Dynamics 365 | flagship dataset; Open311 standard retired | **standardize** |

…plus the batch of ten above (Transact · Expose · Unify · Operationalize · Anchor · Consolidate & Own · Unlock).
